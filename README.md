# hangman

this is my online hangman project for General Assembly. It supports one and two player games of hangman.



### technologies

it is constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 ### features

 - support for one or two players
 - reset game feature
 - over 2000 words to play with in single player
 - support for capital or lowercase letters in multiplayer
 - uses dictionary API in multiplayer to make sure a word is real
 
 ### for the future: 
 
 - unfortunately, entering a single letter is currently a loophole in multiplayer. merriam-webster treats individual letters like words in their API, so that would have to be circumvented somehow.
 
 - draw the man being hung, of course!
